https://book-collect.herokuapp.com/

**Author**: Rob Carter and Josh Williams
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This app allows a user to search for books by entering an author's name or a book title. It then allows the user to save books they like for future reference.

## Getting Started
Download all the configurations in the package.json. Set up a PORT and DATABASE_URL in a .env file.

## Architecture
This app uses JavaScript, EJS, CSS, and Node.js. It is deployed on Heroku. It has a SQL schema called books, and it uses PostGres for the database.
